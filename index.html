                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of e poducated people. Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India .

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to
                be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on
                social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power
                to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must
                for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a
                lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…

                For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which
                almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a
                practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.
